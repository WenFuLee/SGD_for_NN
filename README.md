An Empirical Study: Selection of Optimization Algorithms for Neural Networks
==============================
This is the final project of [CS532](https://willett.ece.wisc.edu/teaching/fall-2017-532/) at UW-Madison

We have implemented SGD, [AdaGrad](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/duchi11a/duchi11a.pdf), and [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980).

We also provide some insights into these methods and toy example in our [report](https://github.com/YuanTingHsieh/SGD_for_NN/blob/master/Final_Project.pdf).

We tested our implementations with 2-layer NN on [MNIST](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf) dataset.
